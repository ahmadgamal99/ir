When using reactive programming , data streams are going to be the spine of your application . Events , messages , calls ,
and even failures are going to be conveyed by a data stream . With reactive programming , you observe these streams and react when
a value is emitted . So , in your code , you are going to create data streams of anything and from anything : click events ,
HTTP requests , ingested messages , availability notifications , changes on a variable , cache events , measures from a sensor
